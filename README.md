# Assignment 1: Led Fade

OverView:In this assignment I made a LED fade in and out.

Code file name:LED Fade(CurcuitPython).py

Tips & Tricks

This assignment was the first of the year and very much so an introduction to CircuitPython. The objective of the assignment was to make an LED fade in, and out of brightness. The wiring is fairly simple, and I have no particular tips, because it's such a simple circuit. As far as the code is concerned, using  a bool function is important here because it makes things much easier. Using a bool function, or a true-false statement gives two options true, or false.With these two options you should see them as an up or down, instead of true or false. Up(true) being the code you write for the LED fading in, and down(false) is the code you write for the LED fading out.

# Assignment 2: Servo

OverView:In this assignment I use captive touch to control a servo.

Code file name:Capacitive Touch and servo(CurcuitPython).py

Tips & Tricks
Captive touch might seem like this new technology that you’ve never seen before, but in reality captive touch is just a button that you can’t see. Using wire as a button is just as simple as coding a wire button, which is almost identical to wiring a button.

# Assignment 3: LCD and Button
OverView:In this assignment I use a button to control an lcd to count up or down.

Code file name:LCD and button(CurcuitPython).py

Tips & Tricks: This is one of the harder assignments then the others. It will be one of the first obstacles that you run into will be errors and a lot of them. The first error most people came into contact with was having and updated metro, this issue was a big obstacle, because of just pure 
technical errors, however, the problem is mostly fixed, so whoever is reading this should not have this problem. The second error was the error about spacing(you'll know it when you see it) just add a space and you should be good to go(look at the bottom of the code). Other than those two errors it should be fairly straight forward.
